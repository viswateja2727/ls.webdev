          <h1>Introduction</h1>
          <br />
          <p>
            Badminton is a racket sport played by either two opposing players
            (singles) or two opposing pairs (doubles), who take positions on
            opposite halves of a rectangular court that is divided by a net.
            Players score points by striking a shuttlecock with their racket so
            that it passes over the net and lands in their opponents' half of
            the court. A rally ends once the shuttlecock has struck the ground,
            and the shuttlecock may only be struck once by each side before it
            passes over the net.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            The shuttlecock (or shuttle) is a feathered projectile whose unique
            aerodynamic properties cause it to fly differently from the balls
            used in most racket sports; in particular, the feathers create much
            higher drag, causing the shuttlecock to decelerate more rapidly than
            a ball. Shuttlecocks have a much higher top speed, when compared to
            other racket sports. As the shuttlecock flight is stubbornly
            affected by wind, competitive badminton is always played indoors.
            Badminton is also played outdoors as a casual recreational activity,
            often as a garden or beach game.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Since 1992, badminton has been an Liliympic sport with five events:
            men's and women's singles, men's and women's doubles, and mixed
            doubles, in which each pair is a man and a woman. At high levels of
            play, the sport demands excellent fitness: players require aerobic
            stamina, agility, strength, speed, and precision. It is also a
            technical sport, requiring good motor coordination and the
            development of sophisticated racket movements.

          <h1>History</h1>
          <br />
          <p>
            Badminton was known in ancient times; an early form of the sport was
            played in ancient Greece. In Japan, the related game Hanetsuki was
            played as early as the 16th century. In the west, badminton came
            from a game called battledore and shuttlecock, in which two or more
            players keep a feathered shuttlecock in the air with small rackets.
            The game was called "Poona" in India during the 18th century, and
            British Army officers stationed there took a competitive Indian
            version back to England in the 1860s, where it was played at country
            houses as an upper class amusement. Isaac Spratt, a London toy
            dealer, published a booklet, "Badminton Battledore - a new game" in
            1860, but unfortunately no copy has survived.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            The new sport was definitively launched in 1873 at the Badminton
            House, Gloucestershire, owned by the Duke of Beaufort. During that
            time, the game was referred to as "The Game of Badminton," and the
            game's official name became Badminton.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Until 1887 the sport was played in England under the rules that
            prevailed in India. The Bath Badminton Club standardized the rules
            and made the game applicable to English ideas. The basic regulations
            were drawn up in 1887. In 1893, the Badminton Association of England
            published the first set of rules according to these regulations,
            similar to today's rules, and officially launched badminton in a
            house called "Dunbar" at 6 Waverley Grove, Portsmouth, England on
            September 13 of that year. They also started the All England Open
            Badminton Championships, the first badminton competition in the
            world, in 1899.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            The International Badminton Federation (IBF) (now known as Badminton
            World Federation) was established in 1934 with Canada, Denmark,
            England, France, the Netherlands, Ireland, New Zealand, Scotland,
            and Wales as its founding members. India joined as an affiliate in
            1936. The BWF now governs international badminton and develops the
            sport globally.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            While originated in England, international badminton has
            traditionally been dominated by a few Asian countries, plus Denmark
            from Europe. China, Indonesia, South Korea and Malaysia are among
            the nations that have consistently produced world-class players in
            the past few decades and dominated competitions on the international
            level, with China being the most dominant in recent years.

          <h1>12 Basic Rules And Regulations</h1>
          <br />
          <ol>
            <li>A Game of Two or Four:</li>
            <br />
            <p>Badminton can be played as singles or doubles.</p>
            <br />
            <p>
              In a single rally, there will be two players, playing with each
              other.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              While in a double rally, you can pair up with your friend and play
              a game of four. But the players are a set, like the sets of cards.
            </p>
            <br />
            <li>Left or Right:</li>
            <br />
            <p>
              You cannot randomly choose your side as you wish. This is one of
              the basic badminton rule which needs to be followed for any rally.
              At the beginning of the game, when the server's score is even,
              then you are at the right service court. If the servers score is
              odd, choose the left side. (yes! Be thorough with odd or even
              numbers, they do count!!)
            </p>
            <br />
            <li>Know Your Weapons:</li>
            <br />
            <p>
              Badminton is played with a stringed racket and a shuttlecock. The
              cock is topped with feathers and have a rubber base. The player
              should always hit the rubber base and not the feathered part. Each
              player can use a single stringed racket.
            </p>
            <br />
            <li>The serve:</li>
            <br />
            <p>
              The serve is the basic of any badminton play. Serve is the term
              used according to badminton rules, to hit the cock during the
              beginning of each rally. Serve should always be done underarm and
              below the server's waist. An overarm serve is against the rules of
              badminton, and would be considered a fault. (your physics rule of
              high velocity, does not suffice here!)
            </p>
            <br />
            <li>Begin It By a Toss:</li>
            <br />
            <p>
              The basic rule and regulation of any badminton rally, either
              Olympics or your family play is that, the game always begins with
              a toss. When playing with your friends, stop fighting for the
              first serve, because you are within the box of the badminton
              rules! The start is only hosted by a toss; the next first serve
              depends on who wins the rally. If you win the first rally, then
              the next game begins with your serve. (perks of being the winner).
            </p>
            <br />
            <li>The 'Net' Trap:</li>
            <br />
            <p>
              The net is a vital and villainous equipment in the play. If the
              shuttle cock hits the net or even touches the net, disqualified!
              The point goes to your opponent.
            </p>
            <br />
            <li>Tame Your Hands and Your Feet:</li>
            <br />
            <p>
              While the play is on, your feet should never touch the white line
              bordered around you. Your hands are your rackets, a hand touch is
              a foul play, which is beyond the shadow of any doubt..
            </p>
            <br />
            <li>“That's a Foul Play”!:</li>
            <br />
            <p>
              According to the basic rules of badminton, if your cock touches
              the ground or if you hit it twice from the same court, that's
              considered a foul play. So there's no replay or second chance. “In
              the game of badminton, you either loose or win, there's never a
              chance!”
            </p>
            <br />
            <li>Don't Be A Bully:</li>
            <br />
            <p>
              While a play you should never back or temp your opponent while
              he/she is serving, which may ward off their concentration.
              Feinting the opponents or trying to bully them by any means is
              unpardonably offensive. Being a sportsman you will obviously never
              be the bullying little kid anymore.
            </p>
            <br />
            <li>The Landing:</li>
            <br />
            <p>
              The shuttlecock which is either served or hit, should land inside
              the service court. Any cock which flew away the white boundaries
              will not be counted and yes, your opponent will definitely score.
            </p>
            <br />
            <li>Dock Out!:</li>
            <br />
            <p>
              If the following rules of badminton are continuously broken by a
              player, then the referee has the undue right to dock out the
              player's point or the player from the game. Be alert! Your actions
              rules your future.
            </p>
            <br />
            <li>21 Steps Ahead:</li>
            <br />
            <p>
              To win the game of badminton you must score points before your
              opponent. Out of 3 sets of play you must win 2 to be the talented
              winner.

          <h1>Techniques for Holding the Racket</h1>
          <br />
          <p>
            One of the most fundamental aspects of playing badminton is
            mastering the proper grip and holding techniques for the racket. The
            way you hold the racket directly affects your control, power, and
            accuracy when striking the shuttlecock. Let's explore some essential
            techniques for holding the racket correctly:
          </p>
          <br />
          <ol>
            <li>Forehand grip:</li>
            <br />
            <p>
              The forehand grip is the most commonly used grip in badminton. It
              provides versatility and allows for effective shots both at the
              front and back of the court. To achieve the forehand grip, follow
              these steps:
            </p>
            <br />
            <ul>
              <li>
                Hold the racket handle as if you are shaking hands with it.
              </li>

              <br />
              <li>
                Place your thumb against the wider flat surface of the racket
                handle.
              </li>
              <br />
              <li>
                Wrap your fingers around the handle, ensuring a firm but not
                overly tight grip.
              </li>
              <br />
              <li>
                The racket face should be perpendicular to the ground, allowing
                you to strike the shuttlecock effectively.
              </li>
              <br />
            </ul>
            <li>Backend grip:</li>
            <br />
            <p>
              Mastering the backhand grip is essential for executing powerful
              and accurate shots. Follow these steps to achieve the backhand
              grip:
            </p>
            <br />
            <ul>
              <li>Start with the forehand grip as a foundation.</li>
              <br />
              <li>
                Gradually move your hand down the handle, reaching towards the
                end.
              </li>
              <br />
              <li>
                Turn your wrist anticlockwise for right-handed players or
                clockwise for left-handed players to make a minor alteration.
              </li>
              <br />
              <li>
                The back of your hand should face the net, allowing you to
                generate power and control during backhand shots.
              </li>
              <br />
            </ul>
            <li>Serve grip:</li>
            <br />
            <p>
              The serve grip is crucial for delivering accurate and controlled
              serves. Follow these steps to achieve the optimal serve grip:

          <br />
          <p>
            The serve is a crucial aspect of badminton, as it determines the
            beginning of each rally and offers an opportunity to gain an
            advantage over your opponent. Implementing effective serving
            strategies can put pressure on your opponent and set the tone for
            the game. Here are some key serving strategies to consider:
          </p>
          <br />
          <ol>
            <li>Short Serve:</li>
            <br />
            <p>
              The short serve is executed by hitting the shuttlecock in such a
              way that it falls closer to the net on the opponent's side. This
              type of serve aims to limit the opponent's options and create an
              opportunity for an attacking shot.
            </p>
            <br />
            <ul>
              <li>
                Stand close to the front boundary line of your side of the
                court.
              </li>
              <br />
              <li>
                Use a gentle flick of the wrist to hit the shuttlecock over the
                net with a shallow trajectory.
              </li>
              <br />
              <li>
                Aim to make the shuttlecock land in the front mid-court area of
                your opponent's side.
              </li>
              <br />
              <li>
                Follow up with a quick follow-up shot to take control of the
                rally.
              </li>
              <br />
            </ul>
            <li>Long Serve:</li>
            <br />
            <p>
              The long serve is aimed at pushing your opponent towards the back
              boundary line and gaining a positional advantage. It requires a
              greater amount of power and accuracy.
            </p>
            <br />
            <ul>
              <li>
                Stand closer to the back boundary line of your side of the
                court.
              </li>
              <br />
              <li>
                Utilize a stronger swing and hit the shuttlecock with a higher
                trajectory to clear the net and reach the back of your
                opponent's court.
              </li>
              <br />
              <li>
                Aim for the farthest area from your opponent, near the back
                boundary line.
              </li>
              <br />
              <li>
                Follow up with a defensive position to counter your opponent's
                return shot.
              </li>
              <br />
            </ul>
            <li>Flick Serve:</li>
            <br />
            <p>
              The flick serve is a deceptive technique that surprises your
              opponent by making them believe you're performing a short serve
              when, in fact, you execute a long serve.
            </p>
            <br />

            <ul>
              <li>Begin with a similar motion as the short serve.</li>
              <br />
              <li>
                Use a sudden acceleration of your wrist to hit the shuttlecock
                with more power, causing it to travel deeper into your
                opponent's court.
              </li>
              <br />
              <li>Aim for the backcourt area, close to the boundary line.</li>
              <br />
              <li>
                Maintain a neutral stance to be ready for your opponent's
                response.
              </li>
              <br />
            </ul>
          </ol>
          <p>
            By implementing these well-planned serving strategies, you can gain
            an immediate advantage and seize control of the game. Nevertheless,
            it is crucial to acquaint yourself with the regulations, scoring
            system, and possible infractions in badminton to uphold the
            principles of fair competition.
